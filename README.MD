# Overview

This software chooses a random number 1-100 and takes a number from the user. It compares the two to see if they are the same. If they are, the user wins. If they are not, a hint is displayed to the GUI. The user gets 10 chances.

To run the program, a user would download the environment into a KDJ prepared environment. Click the 'Run' button from the main menu. Insert guess.

My purpose in creating a number guesser was to create a fun game for my kids to play.
